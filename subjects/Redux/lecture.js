/*
- Flux is an architecture, not a framework
  - DO NOT START BUILDING STUFF WITH FLUX WHEN YOU'RE FIRST GETTING STARTED WITH REACT
  - It can be difficult to understand why the patterns in Flux are useful if you haven't
    already tried to solve problems w/out Flux
  - You'll most likely hate Flux unless you're already fighting with your current JS
    framework. If you're not, stick with what's working for you

- Flux is good at:
  - Making it easy to reason about changes to state

- Remember our 2 questions:
  - What state is there?
  - When does it change?

Open Redux.png

- Views
  - React components (see components)
  - Create actions (see actions)

- Actions
  - Create "actions" with meaningful names (e.g. "load contacts", "delete contact").
    These are the verbs. Ask yourself, "what actions can the user take?"
  - Send actions through the dispatcher
  - Possibly trigger API requests (side effect)

- Store
  - Synchronous dispatch of actions to ALL registered listeners (stores)

- Reducers
  - Compute new state values
