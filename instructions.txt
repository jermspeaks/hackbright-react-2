Ronke - thanks for connecting us, and scheduling the next Alumnae Tech Talk! 

Hi Jeremy, 

First off, thanks for mentoring at Hackbright! I'm really looking forward to having you host our Alumnae Tech Talk on React 2.0 on 12/6 from 6:30-8PM here at Hackbright Academy for our alumnae community! As the date gets closer, I'll touch base with you again on logistics for the evening; however, if you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out. 

Can you please send me the following by early next month: 
brief description of your React 2.0 Workshop
brief bio about yourself
Looking forward to having you back at Hackbright! 

Thank you,
