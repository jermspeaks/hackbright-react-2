# React Techniques

Welcome to the react workshop course with Jeremy at Hackbright. Last given December 12th, 2017.

This repo contains workshop material. I have assumed your computer has the following installed:

- [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/) (latest stable version)

Then:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jermspeaks/hackbright-react-2
$ cd hackbright-react-2
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a list of subjects.

Here are the [notes](https://github.com/jermspeaks/hackbright-react-2/blob/master/notes.md) for the workshop.
